    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        Chilo Printing is a small business specializing in 3D-printed fidget toys. Our mission is to provide high-quality, affordable designs that help people focus, relieve stress, and have fun. 
        Founded in 2025, Chilo Printing was created by two young students passionate about 3D printing and fidget toys. 
        What began as a hobby quickly grew into a small business built on creativity and attention to detail. Our goal is to create entertaining and functional fidget toys that suit a wide range of preferences and needs.

        As the founders are under 18, our names are not shared online for privacy reasons. However, you can often find us at local car boot sales where we showcase and sell our prints.
